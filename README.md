# embedding-extraction
Embedding Extraction is a proposed method for BERTweet Layer Extraction which utilized the output of each encoder layer in BERTweet. This repository is made to show how Embedding Extraction works for 8 different scenarios. The 8 scenarios are All 12 Layers, Last Layer, 

This method is used in my paper titled "A BERTweet-based Design for Monitoring Behaviour Change Based on Five Doors Theory on Coral Bleaching Campaign" on Journal of Big Data.
